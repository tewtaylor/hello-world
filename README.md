# hello-world
Let's get started with GitHub!

My name is Taylor Tew, and I am a Master of Engineering student at Duke University specializing in Cardiac & Neuroengineering. I want to learn GitHub to aid in the development of the Final Project for Dr. Grill's Fundamentals of Electrical Stimulation course, in which my group and I are modeling the effects of Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation at the nerve terminal of the Ulnar Nerve with the thumb muscle with varying electrode positions, tissue compositions, and tissue thicknesses.
